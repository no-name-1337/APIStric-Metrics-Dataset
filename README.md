# APIstic-Metrics-Dataset

Given the potential size  of the dataset, making it cumbersome to download in its entirety, we created for APIstics a user-friendly web interface. This interface will allow users to navigate the dataset with ease, applying specific metrics tailored to their needs and downloading only the segments of interest. Additionally, the interface will provide convenient tools for visualizing data distributions and values based on selected metrics.

For the purposes of a double-blind review, we are  not giving a link for the deployment location of the APIstic's web ap, and we are including a brief demonstration video that showcases the current iteration of our dataset navigation tool. We're also commited to ongoing enhancement of the dataset and it's navigation tool. This includes the addition of new entries, detailed information, and more intuitive filters. These improvements encompass the integration of natural language processing for contextual API searches and the ability to search by example, allowing users to find APIs with structures similar to their query examples.

Please Watch Demo Video on APIstics's Web App:
